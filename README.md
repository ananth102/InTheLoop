# InTheLoop
A Chrome extension that improves the School Loop interface by letting users enter a sandbox mode in which they can calculate what their grades would be after the teacher inputs or deletes grades.

##Installation
InTheLoop is still in development, but the beta version is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/in-the-loop-for-school-lo/ppigcngidmooiiafkelbilbojiijffag).
Note: This extension only works for number grades (not for letter grades like "A")

##Future Features:   
1. Improved user interface 
2. Add a function that displays total # of points per category and overall
3. More robust grade calculation (function even with letter grades instead of numbers)
4. ~~Work with point-based grading system~~
5. Add and edit categories
6. Final grade calculation
7. Handle [this](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t34.0-12/12395361_1647944725464690_391096720_n.jpg?oh=a616ca29147d5ecedfc4a79247d47484&oe=567014EB).
8. Better Chrome Store logos and icon (instead of using School Loop's icon)

##Changelog
0.0.7 - Attempted fix for points-based (no weightage) grade parsing by detecting 
Priorities for future release:    
1. UX/Design - mainly move the row above table header    
2. Bug Fixes - Parsing EC/NaN errors
